# Homework 1

## Building

The makefile provides a convenient shorthand for building. To build run (from root directory):
`make`

## Running

The makefile provides a convenient shorthand for executing. To run HW1, run (from root directory):
`make run`

You should see an output as shown:
```
Your input: <input>
AES: <input>
Blowfish: <input>
RSA: <input>
Signature: <signature>
Signature authentic: <true/false>
```

Each output is the ecrypted then decrypted version of the plaintext input (of the signature + authenticity).
